//Game choice: choose your own adventure

// 1. Declare variables for game state and player choices.
// - Declare a variable to track the current location of the player.
// - Declare variables to store player choices for levels (choice1, choice2)

// 2. Create HTML elements for displaying game scenes and player choices.
// - Create elements to display the current scene description.
// - Create elements for choice buttons( I will create 2 buttons for choices.).

// 3. Create cached element references for the game scene display and choice buttons.
// - Cache reference for the scene description display.
// - Cache references for each choice button.

// 4. Add event listeners for the choice buttons.
// - Add event listeners to detect when a player clicks a choice button.
// - The event listener should capture the player's choice and update the game state accordingly.

// 5. Write an initialization function to set up the initial game state.
// - Set the initial location to the starting point
// - Set up the initial scene description and available choices.
// - Invoke the render function to display the initial scene.

// 6. Stub up a handleChoice() function for the event listeners to call.
// - Capture the player's choice and update the game state for next level.
// - Check if the player's choice leads to a new scene or ends the game.
// - If the game is not over, call the render() function to update the display.

//7. Within the render() function:
// - Update the scene description to match the player's current location.
// - Update the visibility and text of the choice buttons based on the player's options.

// 8. Handle end-of-game scenarios:
// - If the player wins or loses, display the appropriate message.
// - Provide an option to restart the game by resetting the game state and calling the initialization function.
